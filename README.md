The purpose of this project was to parse through a web API and take needed informations.
When lauching, you'll have to wait till the programme takes all information from the server.
When finished, input field and button selection will be revealed.

# Input field
In this project there is an input field.
Its purpose is to search the pokemon through all pokemon's pictures.
